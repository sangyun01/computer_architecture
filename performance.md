# Major Formulas in Computer Architecture

## 1. Performance

- **Definition of Response time(latency, execution time)**  

$$
\text{Performance}_X = \frac{1}{\text{Execution Time}_X}
$$

- **Relative Performance Comparison**  
When comparing two systems \(X\) and \(Y\):

$$
\frac{\text{Performance}_X}{\text{Performance}_Y} 
= \frac{\text{Execution Time}_Y}{\text{Execution Time}_X}
$$
